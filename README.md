# Confidential Sidecar Containers
This repository contains the code needed to build the sidecar containers used for [confidential containers.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/microsoft-introduces-preview-of-confidential-containers-on-azure/ba-p/3410394)

The code in this repository should be located at ``$GOPATH/src/microsoft/confidential-sidecar-containers``.

## Secure key release (SKR) sidecar
The ``docker/skr/build.sh`` script builds all necessary Go tools for secure key release as standalone binaries and creates a Docker image that contains them so that it 
can be used as a sidecar container. The skr sidecar container is executed by calling the script ``skr.sh``. More information about the skr API can be found [here.](cmd/skr/README.md)

The skr sidecar can be queried by application containers hosted in the same pod (or container group) for retrieving attestation reports and for releasing secrets from managed HSM key vaults.

The ``examples/skr`` shows an example of how the skr sidecar can be deployed and tested within a confidential container group on ACI.

## Fetching an attestion report.
``tools/get-snp-report`` provides a tool which will return an SNP attestation report from the AMD PSP via linux IOCTLs. it can take a hex encoded report data value on the command line. The output is a hex encoded binary object. If piped through hex2report it can be read by people. There are two implementations inside the one tool to support the different IOCTLs requirements between linux 5.15 and 6.1 and later.

### Third-party code 
We modified the [AES unwrap key without padding method](https://github.com/NickBall/go-aes-key-wrap/blob/master/keywrap.go) to implement the aes key unwrap with padding method.

## Encrypted filesystem sidecar
The ``docker/encfs/build.sh`` script builds all necessary Go tools (for encrypted filesystems) and creates a Docker image that contains them so that it can be used as a sidecar container. The encrypted filesystem sidecar container is executed by calling the script ``encfs.sh`` with a base64-encoded string or as an environment variable. The entry point to the sidecar is the [remotefs tool](cmd/remotefs/README.md) which leverages the [azmount tool.](cmd/azmount/README.md) 

The encrypted filesystem sidecar uses the SKR library to release key material from Azure Key Vault instances required for mounting the encrypted filesystems required by the application.

The ``examples/encfs`` shows an example of how the encrypted filesystem sidecar can be deployed within a confidential container group on ACI.

## Dependencies:
- Golang 1.19 or later
- Docker
- GCC 9.4.0 or later
