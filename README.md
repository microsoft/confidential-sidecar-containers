# Confidential Sidecar Containers

This repository contains the code needed to build the sidecar containers used for [confidential containers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/microsoft-introduces-preview-of-confidential-containers-on-azure/ba-p/3410394).

The code in this repository should be located at ``$GOPATH/src/microsoft/confidential-sidecar-containers``.

## Testing

[![CI](https://github.com/microsoft/confidential-sidecar-containers/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=schedule)](https://github.com/microsoft/confidential-sidecar-containers/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Each sidecar is tested under `./tests/<sidecar_name>`. Each directory is tested with [confidential-aci-testing](https://github.com/microsoft/confidential-aci-testing), and therefore contains:

- A `docker-compose` file which describes the images to build. These typically include a primary container image which uses the sidecar.
- A `bicep` deployment template which describes the ACI deployment.
- A `test.py` file which uses `unittest` and orchestrates, building, pushing and testing the containers. This target is what is called in our nightly testing.

There are also supplementary files which aid the deployment:
- `deployments/` contains bicep templates and for long lived resources used by the tests, they are run once.
- `cacitesting.env` This file describes the deployment conditions such as which subscription and resource group to deploy to. All required properties are populated, any unset values are optional/have default values.

## Secure key release (SKR) sidecar

The ``docker/skr/build.sh`` script builds all necessary Go tools for secure key release as standalone binaries and creates a Docker image that contains them so that it
can be used as a sidecar container. The skr sidecar container is executed by calling the script ``skr.sh``. More information about the skr API can be found [here](cmd/skr/README.md).

The skr sidecar can be queried by application containers hosted in the same pod (or container group) for retrieving attestation reports and for releasing secrets from managed HSM key vaults.

The ``examples/skr`` shows an example of how the skr sidecar can be deployed and tested within a confidential container group on ACI.

### Fetching an attestion report

``tools/get-snp-report`` provides a tool which will return an SNP attestation report from the AMD PSP via linux IOCTLs. it can take a hex encoded report data value on the command line. The output is a hex encoded binary object. If piped through hex2report it can be read by people. There are two implementations inside the one tool to support the different IOCTLs requirements between linux 5.15 and 6.1 and later.

### Third-party code

The [AES unwrap key without padding method](https://github.com/NickBall/go-aes-key-wrap/blob/master/keywrap.go) code was modified to implement the aes key unwrap with padding method.

## Encrypted Filesystem sidecar

The ``docker/encfs/build.sh`` script builds all necessary Go tools (for encrypted filesystems) and creates a Docker image that contains them so that it can be used as a sidecar container. The encrypted filesystem sidecar container is executed by calling the script ``encfs.sh`` with a base64-encoded string as an environment variable or a command-line argument. The entry point to the sidecar is the [remotefs tool](cmd/remotefs/README.md) which leverages the [azmount tool](cmd/azmount/README.md).

The encrypted filesystem sidecar uses the SKR library to release key material from Azure Key Vault instances required for mounting the encrypted filesystems required by the application.

The ``examples/encfs`` shows an example of how the encrypted filesystem sidecar can be deployed within a confidential container group on ACI.
